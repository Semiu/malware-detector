The implementation details of this project can be found in both `MS-malware-suspectibility-detection` and `MS-malware-suspectibility-detection-refactored` folders. The two folders are kept for teaching code refactoring and writing clean codes generally. Also, the MS-malware-suspectibility-detection-refactored` contains additional steps such as model stacking, among others, to improve the prediction model.
